A productivity app that I've developed over about a week at General Assembly with William Scott, Adonis Casado and Erika Pinzon.

A platform designed to allow freelancers to create beautiful service forms for their clients, and to keep track of the tasks that they've obtained.

- **Form Editor** - Create a custom form with a Google Forms-like interface, with support for text, checkbox and radio fields. These forms can then be filled out by other users, and the results of these forms can be viewed later.
- **Dashboard** - Have an overview of all your current forms, where you can assign them their priorities.
